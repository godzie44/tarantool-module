//! High-level zero-cost bindings for Lua (fork of
//! [hlua](https://crates.io/crates/hlua))
//!
//! Lua is an interpreted programming language. This crate allows you to execute Lua code.
//!
//! # General usage
//!
//! In order to execute Lua code you first need a *Lua context*, which is represented in this
//! library with [the `Lua` struct](struct.Lua.html). You can then call the
//! the [`eval`](struct.Lua.html#method.eval) or
//! [`exec`](struct.Lua.html#method.exec) method on this object.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```
//! use tlua::Lua;
//!
//! let mut lua = Lua::new();
//! lua.exec("a = 12 * 5").unwrap();
//! let a: u32 = lua.eval("return a + 1").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! This example puts the value `60` in the global variable `a`. The values of all global variables
//! are stored within the `Lua` struct. If you execute multiple Lua scripts on the same context,
//! each script will have access to the same global variables that were modified by the previous
//! scripts.
//!
//! In order to do something actually useful with Lua, we will need to make Lua and Rust
//! communicate with each other. This can be done in four ways:
//!
//! - You can use methods on the `Lua` struct to read or write the values of global variables with
//!   the [`get`](struct.Lua.html#method.get) and [`set`](struct.Lua.html#method.set) methods. For
//!   example you can write to a global variable with a Lua script then read it from Rust, or you
//!   can write to a global variable from Rust then read it from a Lua script.
//!
//! - The Lua script that you evaluate with the [`eval`](struct.Lua.html#method.eval) method
//!   can return a value.
//!
//! - You can set the value of a global variable to a Rust functions or closures, which can then be
//!   invoked with a Lua script. See [the `Function` struct](struct.Function.html) for more
//!   information. For example if you set the value of the global variable `foo` to a Rust
//!   function, you can then call it from Lua with `foo()`.
//!
//! - Similarly you can set the value of a global variable to a Lua function, then call it from
//!   Rust. The function call can return a value.
//!
//! Which method(s) you use depends on which API you wish to expose to your Lua scripts.
//!
//! # Pushing and loading values
//!
//! The interface between Rust and Lua involves two things:
//!
//! - Sending values from Rust to Lua, which is known as *pushing* the value.
//! - Sending values from Lua to Rust, which is known as *loading* the value.
//!
//! Pushing (ie. sending from Rust to Lua) can be done with
//! [the `set` method](struct.Lua.html#method.set):
//!
//! ```
//! # use tlua::Lua;
//! # let mut lua = Lua::new();
//! lua.set("a", 50);
//! ```
//!
//! You can push values that implement [the `Push` trait](trait.Push.html) or
//! [the `PushOne` trait](trait.PushOne.html) depending on the situation:
//!
//! - Integers, floating point numbers and booleans.
//! - `String` and `&str`.
//! - Any Rust function or closure whose parameters and loadable and whose return type is pushable.
//!   See the documentation of [the `Function` struct](struct.Function.html) for more information.
//! - [The `AnyLuaValue` struct](struct.AnyLuaValue.html). This enumeration represents any possible
//!   value in Lua.
//! - The [`LuaCode`](struct.LuaCode.html) and
//!   [`LuaCodeFromReader`](struct.LuaCodeFromReader.html) structs. Since pushing these structs can
//!   result in an error, you need to use [`checked_set`](struct.Lua.html#method.checked_set)
//!   instead of `set`.
//! - `Vec`s and `HashMap`s whose content is pushable.
//! - As a special case, `Result` can be pushed only as the return type of a Rust function or
//!   closure. If they contain an error, the Rust function call is considered to have failed.
//! - As a special case, tuples can be pushed when they are the return type of a Rust function or
//!   closure. They implement `Push` but not `PushOne`.
//! - TODO: userdata
//!
//! Loading (ie. sending from Lua to Rust) can be done with
//! [the `get` method](struct.Lua.html#method.get):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use tlua::Lua;
//! # let mut lua = Lua::new();
//! let a: i32 = lua.get("a").unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! You can load values that implement [the `LuaRead` trait](trait.LuaRead.html):
//!
//! - Integers, floating point numbers and booleans.
//! - `String` and [`StringInLua`](struct.StringInLua.html) (ie. the equivalent of `&str`). Loading
//!   the latter has no cost while loading a `String` performs an allocation.
//! - Any function (Lua or Rust), with [the `LuaFunction` struct](struct.LuaFunction.html). This
//!   can then be used to execute the function.
//! - [The `AnyLuaValue` struct](struct.AnyLuaValue.html). This enumeration represents any possible
//!   value in Lua.
//! - [The `LuaTable` struct](struct.LuaTable.html). This struct represents a table in Lua, where
//!   keys and values can be of different types. The table can then be iterated and individual
//!   elements can be loaded or modified.
//! - As a special case, tuples can be loaded when they are the return type of a Lua function or as
//!   the return type of [`eval`](struct.Lua.html#method.eval).
//! - TODO: userdata
